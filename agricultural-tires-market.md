<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Agriculture Tires</li><li>Bias (Crossply) Agriculture Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The agricultural tires market encompasses two main types: radial and bias (crossply) tires. Radial agriculture tires feature a design with cords positioned at a right angle to the tireâ€™s tread, offering improved traction, stability, and fuel efficiency, making them suitable for high-speed and versatile operations. In contrast, bias tires have layers of fabric plies running diagonally, providing a more robust structure that enhances durability under heavy loads, albeit with less flexibility than radial tires. Both types cater to diverse farming needs.</p></p>
