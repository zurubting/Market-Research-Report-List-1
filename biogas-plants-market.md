<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biogas Plants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Digestion</li><li>Dry Digestion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Biogas plants operate primarily through two digestion processes: wet digestion and dry digestion. Wet digestion involves the breakdown of organic materials in a liquid medium, ideal for high-moisture content feedstocks, resulting in efficient biogas production. In contrast, dry digestion is suited for low-moisture organic materials, utilizing a solid substrate, which often leads to higher biogas concentration but requires more space. Both methods cater to diverse waste types, contributing to renewable energy generation and waste management solutions in the biogas market.</p></p>
