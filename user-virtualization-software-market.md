<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The User Virtualization Software Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-persistent VDI</li><li>Persistent VDI</li></ul></p>
<p><p>User virtualization software encompasses two main types of Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI): persistent and non-persistent. Non-persistent VDI delivers a temporary desktop environment that resets after each use, ideal for task-based users needing quick access without personal customization. In contrast, persistent VDI provides a dedicated desktop that saves user settings and data between sessions, catering to those requiring a stable, personalized environment for productivity. Both models address different organizational needs in desktop management and user experience.</p></p>
