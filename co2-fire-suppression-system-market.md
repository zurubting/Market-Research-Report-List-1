<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CO2 Fire Suppression System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Pressure CO2 Systems</li><li>Low Pressure CO2 Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The CO2 fire suppression system market is primarily divided into high-pressure and low-pressure systems. High-pressure CO2 systems store carbon dioxide in a liquid state, allowing for rapid discharge and effective fire suppression across large areas. Conversely, low-pressure CO2 systems maintain CO2 in a gaseous state, providing a slower release that is typically used in smaller spaces. Both types are favored for their effectiveness in suppressing fires without damaging sensitive equipment, making them suitable for industries like manufacturing and data centers.</p></p>
