<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Central Air Conditioning Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Expansion(DX) Central Air Conditioning Systems</li><li>Central Plant/Chilled Water Central Air Conditioning System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Central Air Conditioning Systems market primarily comprises two types: Direct Expansion (DX) systems and Central Plant/Chilled Water systems. DX systems utilize refrigerants to cool air directly in the air handling units, making them efficient for smaller applications. In contrast, Central Plant/Chilled Water systems involve a centralized chiller that produces chilled water, which is then circulated to multiple air handling units for larger building cooling needs. Each system serves distinct cooling requirements based on building size and design.</p></p>
