<p><strong>The Fire Sprinkler Pipes Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Pipe Systems</li><li>Dry Pipe Systems</li><li>Deluge Systems</li><li>Pre-Action Systems</li><li>Foam Water Sprinkler Systems</li><li>Water Spray Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fire sprinkler pipes market encompasses various systems designed for fire protection. Wet pipe systems are filled with water and activate when heat triggers the sprinkler heads. Dry pipe systems utilize pressurized air to prevent water from filling pipes until activation occurs. Deluge systems release large amounts of water simultaneously, while pre-action systems require dual triggers for water release. Foam water sprinkler systems use foam agents to suppress flammable liquids, and water spray systems direct water onto hazardous areas, enhancing safety in diverse applications.</p></p>
