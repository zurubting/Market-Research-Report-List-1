<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cranial Fixation and Stabilization System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nonresorbable</li><li>Resorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Cranial Fixation and Stabilization System market is divided into two primary types: nonresorbable and resorbable systems. Nonresorbable systems utilize permanent materials, providing long-term stability for cranial fixation procedures. These are typically used in situations where enduring support is crucial. In contrast, resorbable systems are designed to gradually dissolve in the body, eliminating the need for a second surgery to remove implants. They are preferred in procedures requiring temporary support, promoting natural healing while minimizing foreign material retention.</p></p>
